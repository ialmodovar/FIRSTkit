## Introduction 

We have all seen the increasing importance of statistical literacy in almost all disciplines. Consequently, there is tremendous need for teaching statistics as a introductory core course. Modern statistics is best learn and done with the aid of computational devices, so an essential part of any statistics course is the use of statistical software. One of the most popular statistical software is [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/). However, **R** is challenging specially for those individuals who do not have experience or just do not have the time or need to learn a programming language. [**FIRSTkit**](https://github.com/ialmodovar/FIRSTkit) was created with this in mind. Under the hood, **FIRSTkit** is a Shiny App that is created to be a free companion to the teaching of introductory courses without  any previous programming knowledge. An added benefit is that students and users in the applied disciplines can use the software later as needed.

## Accessing

You can access **FIRSTkit** on the shinyapps.io, [https://ialmodovar.shinyapps.io/FIRSTkit/](https://ialmodovar.shinyapps.io/FIRSTkit/)

## Installation as a R package

**FIRSTkit** is designed to be run from the browser and hosted on an institutional Shiny server so that students and users do not have any need form of installation. 

However, the software can also be installed as an R package. You can install it directly from GitHub via the *devtools* package:

```R
library("devtools")
install_github("ialmodovar/FIRSTkit")
```

Once install the package, you can open *FIRSTkit*

```R
FIRSTkit::FIRSTkit()

## you can also try
library("FIRSTkit")
FIRSTkit()
```
