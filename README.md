## Introduction 

We have all seen the increasing importance of statistical literacy in almost all disciplines. Consequently, there is need for teaching statistics as an introductory core course. Modern statistics is best learnt and done with the aid of computational devices, so an essential part of any statistics course is the use of statistical software. Perhaps the most popular open source statistical software is the   [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) project. However, **R** is challenging, especially for individuals who do not have experience or just do not have the time or need to learn coding or a programming language. An example of such users is provided by students in an introductory statistics class. [**FIRSTkit**](https://github.com/ialmodovar/FIRSTkit) was created with this user in mind. Under the hood, **FIRSTkit** is a Shiny app created to serve as a free companion to the teaching of introductory courses, requiring no prior programming knowledge. An added benefit is that students and users in the applied disciplines can utilize the software as needed, later on.

## Accessing

You can access **FIRSTkit** on the shinyapps.io, [https://ialmodovar.shinyapps.io/FIRSTkit/](https://ialmodovar.shinyapps.io/FIRSTkit/)

## Installation as an R package

**FIRSTkit** is designed to be run from the browser and hosted on an institutional Shiny server, so that students and users do not need any form of installation. 

However, the software can also be installed as an R package. You can install it directly from GitHub via the *devtools* package:

```R
library("devtools")
install_github("ialmodovar/FIRSTkit")
```

If you download the source code, you can install it

```R
library("devtools")
install_local("/path/to/FIRSTkit")
```

Once the package is installed, you can open *FIRSTkit*

```R
FIRSTkit::FIRSTkit()

## You can also try
library("FIRSTkit")
FIRSTkit()
```
