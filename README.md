# First Impressions R-based Statistics Toolkit (FIRSTkit)

## Introduction 

We all have seen the importance of statistics in sciences. Therefore, there is a tremendous need of teaching statistics as a introductory core course. A essential part in any statistics course is the use of a statistical software. On of the most popular statistical software is [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/). However, **R** can be challenging specially for those individuals who do not have any experience or just do not have the time to learn a programming language. [**FIRSTkit**](https://github.com/ialmodovar/FIRSTkit) was created with this in mind. **FIRSTkit** is Shiny App that is created to be free companion to introductory courses without required any previous programming knowledge.
