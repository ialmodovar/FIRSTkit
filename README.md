# First-timers Introductory R-based Statistics Toolkit (FIRSTkit)



# Introduction 

Sometimes we just want to do some basic statistical analysis without required any previous programming knowledge. [FIRSTkit](https://github.com/ialmodovar/FIRSTkit) was created with this in mind. The goal of *FIRSTkit* is to allow first time [R](https://www.r-project.org/) users, or users who have low interest in *R*  coding to perform basic statistics.

## FIRSTkit capabilities

*FIRSTkit* can do the following topics,

* **Descriptive statistics**

  + Location summary 
    + Mean 
    + Median 
    + Geometric Mean
  + Dispersion summary 
    + Standard Deviation
    + Variance 
    + Inter-quartile range
    + MAD
  + Univariate graphical display 
    + box-plot 
    + histograms
    + bar graphs

* **Inference statistics**

  + One-Sample Inference 
    + One-Sample *t* test for a mean
    + Wilcoxon signed-rank test a location
    + One-Sample $\chi^2$ Test for the Variance 
  + Two-Sample Inference
    + Two-Sample *t* test to Compare Two Means
    + Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney to test Compare Two Location 
    + Two-Sample *F* Test to Compare Two Variances
  + Three-Sample or more Inference
    + One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
    + Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test
    + Two-Way ANOVA
    + Friedman rank sum test

* **Linear Regression**

  + Simple linear regression
  + Multiple linear regression
