\section*{Conclusions}

In this paper, we have outlined a framework for designing a web-based, modular, extensible system which reproduces user actions into \R code. We believe that the development strategies weâ€™ve outlined can and should be applied to other software systems, as each of these characteristics aids in the ease-of-use and functionality of the overall product. Although we present them in the context of an introductory statistics application, these ideas are generalizable and we hope that they will gain traction in many other modern software systems.

Since the code is available and these are {\tt .Rmd} files. They can be used as a standalone application.
