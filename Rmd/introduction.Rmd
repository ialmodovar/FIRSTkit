# Introduction 


[**FIRSTkit**](https://github.com/ialmodovar/FIRSTkit) was created to be used as a companion for introductory statistics courses. It does not required any previous knowledge of [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/). This will allow first time  users, or users who have low interest in **R** programming to perform statistical analysis and be successful in their courses.

## FIRSTkit capabilities

User can input their own values for a quick analysis, upload their own datasets. **FIRSTkit** allow to upload *.csv, .txt, .xls, xlsx*.

The following topics are cover in **FIRSTkit**

### **Descriptive statistics**

As a descriptive tools, **FIRSTkit** allow to compute location and dispersion summary. It also allow graphical display to be used in descriptive statistics

  + Location measurements
    + Mean: The sample mean is defined to be,
\[
\bar{x}= \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}x_i
\]
    + Trimmed Mean: This mean is computed after discarding given parts of a probability distribution or sample at the high and low end, and typically discarding an equal amount of both. This number of points to be discarded is usually given as a percentage of the total number of points, but may also be given as a fixed number of points. 

      1- Find the number of observations ($n$).
      
      2- Reorder the $X_i$ from the smallest to the largest.
      
      3- Find lower case $p$ proportion trimmed.
      
      4- Compute $np$. If $np$ is an integer use $k=np$ and trim $k$ observations at both ends. The remaining observations is $n-2k$. The trimmed mean is defined as,
\[
\bar{x}_{k} = \frac{X_{k+1}+X_{k+2}+â€¦+X_{n-k}}{n-2k} 
\]
    + Median: Middle value separating the greater and lesser halves of a data set. The sample median is defined as,
\[
M = X_{(0.5 \times n)}
\]
    + Geometric Mean: The geometric mean of a non-empty data set of (positive) numbers is always at most their arithmetic mean. The geometric mean is defined as,
\[
g = \left(\prod^n_{i=1}x_i\right)^{1/n}
\]
  + Dispersion summary 
    + Standard Deviation: is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. The sample standard deviation is defined as,
\[
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}
\]
    + Variance: is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Informally, it measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. 
\[
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\bar{x})^2
\]
    + Inter-quartile range (IQR): difference between 75th and 25th percentiles. The IQR is defined as
\[
IQR = X_{(0.75 n)}- X_{(0.25 n)}
\]
    + Median Absolute Deviation (MAD): Compute the median absolute deviation, i.e., the (lo-/hi-) median of the absolute deviations from the median, and (by default) adjust by a factor for asymptotically normal consistency.
\[
MAD = \mbox{median}_i(|X_i-\mbox{median}(X_i)|)
\]
    + Range:  the difference between minimum and maximum of all the given arguments.
\[
R = \max X_i - \min X_i
\]

  + Univariate graphical display 
    + Box-plot 
    + Histogram
    + Bargraph
    + Scatter plot (two variables)

### **Inference statistics**

  + One-Sample Inference 
    + One-Sample *t* test for a mean
    + Wilcoxon signed-rank test a location
    + One-Sample $\chi^2$ Test for the Variance 
    + One-Sample proportion test
  + Two-Sample Inference
    + Two-Sample *t* test to compare Two Means
    + Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney to compare Two Location 
    + Two-Sample *F* Test to compare Two Variances
    + Two-Sample proportion test    
  + Three or more Sample Inference
    + One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
    + Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test
  + $\chi^2$ association test

### **Linear Regression**

  + Simple linear regression
  + Multiple linear regression
