# Introduction 


[**FIRSTkit**](https://github.com/ialmodovar/FIRSTkit) was created to be used as a companion for introductory statistics courses. It does not required any previous knowledge of [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/). **FIRSTkit** was made with the purpose to be used as companion to introductory statistics and data sciences courses. Unlike most Shiny-App that are create for basic analysis, **FIRSTkit** is indented to be a companion in introductory courses. Most web-based application are created as a alternative tool for data analysis rather than teaching. This will allow first time users, or users who have low interest in **R** programming to perform statistical analysis and be successful in their courses. 


## FIRSTkit capabilities

User can input their own values for a quick analysis, upload their own datasets. **FIRSTkit** allow to upload *.csv, .txt, .xls, xlsx*. If missing values are present, **FIRSTkit** will be remove them. **FIRSTkit** uses the **R** argument *na.rm=TRUE* whenever is possible. Our software is create to be use in introductory classes. Therefore, **FIRSTkit** consist in topics cover in this class. The topics that are cover in **FIRSTkit** 1) Descriptive Statistics 2) Inference Statistics and 3) Linear regression.

### **Descriptive statistics**

As a descriptive tools, **FIRSTkit** allow to compute location and dispersion summary. It also allow graphical display to be used in descriptive statistics

  + Location measurements
    + **Mean**: The sample mean is defined to be,
\[
\bar{x}= \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}x_i
\]
    + **Trimmed Mean**: This mean is computed after discarding given parts of a probability distribution or sample at the high and low end, and typically discarding an equal amount of both. This number of points to be discarded is usually given as a percentage of the total number of points, but may also be given as a fixed number of points. 

      1- Find the number of observations $n$.
      
      2- Reorder the $X_i$ from the smallest to the largest.
      
      3- Find lower case $p$ proportion trimmed.
      
      4- Compute $np$. If $np$ is an integer use $k=np$ and trim $k$ observations at both ends. The remaining observations is $n-2k$. The trimmed mean is defined as,
\[
\bar{x}_{k} = \frac{X_{k+1}+X_{k+2}+â€¦+X_{n-k}}{n-2k} 
\]
    + **Median**: Middle value separating the greater and lesser halves of a data set. The sample median is defined as,
\[
M = X_{(0.5 \times n)} =\begin{cases}
\frac{X_{(n/2)}+X_{(n/2)+1}}{2} & \mbox{if $n$ is even} \\
X_{(n+1)/2} & \mbox{if $n$ is odd}
\end{cases}
\]
    + **Geometric Mean**: The geometric mean of a non-empty data set of (positive) numbers is always at most their arithmetic mean. The geometric mean is defined as,
\[
g = \left(\prod^n_{i=1}x_i\right)^{1/n}
\]
  + Dispersion summary 
    + **Standard Deviation**: is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. The sample standard deviation is defined as,
\[
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}
\]
    + **Variance**: is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Informally, it measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. 
\[
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\bar{x})^2
\]
    + **Inter-quartile range (IQR)**: difference between 75th and 25th percentiles. The IQR is defined as
\[
IQR = X_{(0.75 n)}- X_{(0.25 n)}
\]
    + **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)**: Compute the median absolute deviation, i.e., the (lo-/hi-) median of the absolute deviations from the median, and (by default) adjust by a factor for asymptotically normal consistency.
\[
MAD = \mbox{median}_i(|X_i-\mbox{median}(X_i)|)
\]
    + **Range**: the difference between minimum and maximum of all the given arguments.
\[
R = \max X_i - \min X_i
\]

  + Univariate graphical display 
    + **Box-plot**:  Graphical tool to depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. Box plots may also have lines extending from the boxes (whiskers) indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, hence the terms box-and-whisker plot and box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers may be plotted as individual points
    + **Histogram**: Graphical approximation of the distribution of numerical variable
    + **Density plot**: Graphical representation of the distribution of a numerical variable. It uses a smooth estimating to show the probability density function of the variable.
    + **Bar Graph**: Graphical tool that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent.
    + **Scatter plot (two variables)**: Graphical display that shows the relationship between two numerical variables $(x,y)$

### **Inference statistics**

  + One-Sample Inference 
    + One-Sample *t* test for the mean: If you have a continuous data and your data is a random sample from a normal population. Then, the one-sample $t$-test is a statistical hypothesis test that can be used to determine whether an unknown population mean is different from a specific value. 
      \[
      H_0: \mu = \mu_0 \mbox{ against } H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0
      \]
    + Wilcoxon signed-ranked test a location parameter: If your sample sizes are very small, you might not be able to test for normality.  When you cannot safely assume normality, you can perform a nonparametric test that does not assume normality
      \[
      H_0: M = M_0 \mbox{ against } H_1: M \neq M_0
      \]

    + One-Sample $\chi^2$ Test for the Variance 
    If you have a continuous data and your data is a random sample from a normal population. Then, the one-sample $\chi^2$ Test for the variance is a statistical hypothesis test that can be used to determine whether an unknown population variance is different from a specific value. 
      \[
      H_0: \sigma^2 = \sigma^2_0 \mbox{ against } H_1: \sigma^2 \neq \sigma^2_0
      \]
    + One-Sample proportion test
    
Performs an exact test of a simple null hypothesis about the probability of success in a Bernoulli experiment.
      \[
      H_0: p = p_0 \mbox{ against } H_1: p \neq p_0
      \]
    
    
  + Two-Sample Inference
  + Dependent $t$-test for paired samples
This test is used when the samples are dependent; that is, when there is only one sample that has been tested twice (repeated measures) or when there are two samples that have been matched or ``paired''.  The $t$ statistic is calculated as
\[
t = \frac{\bar{X}-\delta_0}{s_D/\sqrt{n}}
\]
where $\bar{X}$ are the average and $s_D$ standard deviation of the differences between all pairs. The constant $\delta_0$ is zero if we want to test whether the average of the difference is significantly different. The degree of freedom used is $n-1$, where $n$ represents the number of pairs. 

  + Two-Sample $t$ test to compare Two Means
    
The two-sample $t$-test is used to determine if two population means are equal. 
- The data may either be paired or not paired. By paired, we mean that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the values in the two samples. That is, if $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ and $Y_1, Y_2,\ldots, Y_n$ are the two samples, then $X_i$ corresponds to $Y_i$. For paired samples, the difference $X_i-Y_i$ is usually calculated. For unpaired samples, the sample sizes for the two samples may or may not be equal. The formulas for paired data are somewhat simpler than the formulas for unpaired data.

- The variances of the two samples may be assumed to be equal or unequal. Equal variances yields somewhat simpler formulas, although with computers this is no longer a significant issue.

- In some applications, you may want to adopt a new process or treatment only if it exceeds the current treatment by some threshold. In this case, we can state the null hypothesis in the form that the difference between the two populations means is equal to some constant $\mu_1-\mu_2 =\delta_0$ where the constant is the desired threshold.
    + Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney to compare Two Location 
    + Two-Sample *F* Test to compare Two Variance: If you have a continuous data and your data is a random sample from a normal population. Then, the two-sample $F$-test for the comparison of two variance is a statistical hypothesis test that can be used to determine whether two unknown population variance are different from a specific value. 
      \[
      H_0: \sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2 \mbox{ against } H_1: \sigma^2_1 \neq \sigma^2_2
      \]
    + Two-Sample proportion test    
  + Three or more Sample Inference
    + One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
     If you have a continuous data and your data is a random sample from a normal population. Then, the ANOVA is a statistical hypothesis test that can be used to determine whether an unknown population mean is different from a specific value. 
      \[
      H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_k \mbox{ against } H_1: \mbox{ at least one of them is different}
      \]
    + Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test: If your sample sizes are very small, you might not be able to test for normality.  When you cannot safely assume normality, you can perform a nonparametric test that does not assume normality
      \[
      H_0: M_1 = M_2 = \cdots = M_k \mbox{ against } H_1: \mbox{ at least one of them is different}
      \]

  + $\chi^2$ association test

### **Linear Regression**

Fit a linear regression model, (either simple or multiple)  linear regression. Suppose we have a dependent variable $Y$ and multiple regressors $x_1,\ldots, x_p$. The linear regression accepted in *FIRSTkit* assumed the following structure
\[
Y_i = \beta_0+\sum^p_{j=1}\beta_j x_{ij}+\varepsilon_i
\]
where $Y_i \sim N(\beta_0+\sum^p_{j=1}\beta_j x_{ij},\sigma^2)$ and $\varepsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. In the linear regression the parameters have the following roles, $\beta_0$ is the $y$-intercept. While $\beta_1,\ldots, \beta_p$ are the slope associated with each of the regressors. In linear regression, we are assuming constant variance. *FIRSTkit* report the
