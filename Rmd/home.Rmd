# Introduction 

Sometimes we just want to do some basic statistical analysis without required any previous programming knowledge.  [First Impressions R-based Statistics Toolkit(FIRSTkit)](https://github.com/ialmodovar/FIRSTkit) was created with this in mind. The goal of *FIRSTkit* is to allow first time [R](https://www.r-project.org/) users, or users who have low interest in *R*  coding to perform basic statistics.

## FIRSTkit capabilities

*FIRSTkit* can do the following topics,

* **Descriptive statistics**

  + Location summary 
    + Mean 
    + Median 
    + Geometric Mean
  + Dispersion summary 
    + Standard Deviation
    + Variance 
    + Inter-quartile range
    + Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
  + Univariate graphical display 
    + box-plot 
    + histogram
    + bargraph
* **Inference statistics**

  + One-Sample Inference 
    + One-Sample *t* test for a mean
    + Wilcoxon signed-rank test a location
    + One-Sample $\chi^2$ Test for the Variance 
    + One-Sample proportion test
  + Two-Sample Inference
    + Two-Sample *t* test to Compare Two Means
    + Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney to test Compare Two Location 
    + Two-Sample *F* Test to Compare Two Variances
    + Two-Sample proportion test    
  + Three-Sample Inference
    + One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
    + Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test
    + Two-Way ANOVA
    + Friedman rank sum test

* **Linear Regression**

  + Simple linear regression
  + Multiple linear regression
